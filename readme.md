## Features
 - **Independent Direcitve**: all directives in zhang are independent, you can write them in any file with any order.
 - **More Precise Control**: features, like commodity decimal precision and datetime supported for directive, provide more control
 - **Document Management Enhancement**: zhang has a good document management feature to allow you collect and control document easiler and effective, like receipts.

### Compatibility with beancount
beancount and zhang are both text based accounting tools, and they are some familiar.

But zhang deprecates some directives, like `note`, `pad` and `push_tag`, and aslo evolves some direcitves, like `balance`. So your beancount file may not be compatible with zhang, we will provide a tool to convert beancount format to zhang format, and vice versa.


## Installation
### With Docker
The image is available at `kilerd/zhang`, you shold persist the `/data` folder, which contains all your zhang accounting files.

**NOTE: currently zhang only provide the snapshot version.**

Example for docker compose:
```yaml
version: '3'

volumes:
  zhang_data:
    driver: local

services:
  zhang:
    image: kilerd/zhang:snapshot
    ports:
      # For the web front-end, you may change the port
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "zhang_data:/data"
      # Alternatively, you can mount a local folder
      # - "./zhang_data:/data"
```
#### Compatibility with beancount
zhang has its own file structure, which start with endpoint `main.zhang`. if you wanna start zhang with your beancount file, you may need to specify the endpoint of main file. 

if you are using cli command:
```shell
zhang server /data --endpoint main.bean
```
if you are using docker run command:
```shell
docker run --name zhang -v "/local_beancount_data:/data" -p "18000:8000" kilerd/zhang:snapshot --endpoint main.bc
```
or with docker-compose file:
```yaml
services:
  zhang:
    image: kilerd/zhang:snapshot
    command: --endpoint main.bean
```
